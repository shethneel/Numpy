# Pandas

NumPy is an open source Python library that’s used in almost every field of science and engineering. It’s the universal standard for working with numerical data in Python, and it’s at the core of the scientific Python and PyData ecosystems.

### Numpy is one of the best libraries provided by python. 
### We can do multiple operations with that.

### Numpy Installation :

pip install numpy

Here, you will find everything about **pyton packages** and **ways to install them**.

### Here are some fundamentals for DATA PREPROCESSING such as :

1. List and Array conversion
2. Checking Dimensions of an array
3. Checking the shape, size and datatype of the array
4. Creating array using zeros and ones
5. Creating array of random number
6. random function provides numbers between 0 to 1
7. Arange function
